# Fruit Classifier Project

This is a Fruit Classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with TensorFlow and Keras.  
The model can classify different types of fruits from images.

## Features

- CNN model trained on Fruit-Images-Dataset
- Web app for image upload and classification (Flask backend)
- 131 different fruit classes supported
- Image data augmentation for better accuracy

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment  
3. Install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
4. Run the Flask app: `python app.py`  
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000` and upload fruit images to classify

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Flask app backend  
- `model/fruit_classifier.h5` — Trained CNN model file  
- `templates/` — HTML templates for the web app  
- `static/` — Static files like CSS and uploaded images
